Zero to BinderHub
=================

A guide to help you create your own BinderHub from scratch. Each section below
covers one of the aspects of setting up a BinderHub for your users.

.. note::

   BinderHub uses a JupyterHub running on Kubernetes for most of its functionality.
   This guide assumes you have experience with setting up a JupyterHub on Kubernetes.
   We recommend you follow the `Zero to JupyterHub Guide <https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_
   to familiarize yourself with JupyterHub on Kubernetes before attempting to
   setup a BinderHub.
